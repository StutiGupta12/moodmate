                    Mood Mate â€“ Emotion-Based Activity & Music Recommender
    Mood Mate is a smart, interactive web application that detects your emotional state through a single image capture and offers personalized task suggestions and Spotify playlist recommendations to match your mood.

    ðŸŒŸ Key Features:
    ðŸŽ¥ One-Click Emotion Detection:
    Using a trained deep learning model (model.h5) and your webcam, the app captures a single image and accurately identifies your emotion (e.g., Happy, Sad, Angry, etc.).

    ðŸ’¡ Smart Activity Recommendations:
    Once your emotion is detected, Mood Mate uses LLM-based prompting (via LLaMA3) to suggest custom tasks suited to your current emotional state â€” whether you're looking to calm down, stay productive, or lift your spirits.

    ðŸŽµ Mood-Based Spotify Playlists:
    Integrated with the Spotify API, the app recommends curated playlists that align with your detected mood, enhancing your emotional experience through music.

    ðŸŽ¯ Use Case:
    Perfect for students, professionals, or anyone looking for a quick emotional check-in and personalized support â€” whether through calming tasks, fun activities, or vibe-matching music.
